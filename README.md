# 🛡️ ANTIGRAVITY Ω-PROTO (Model Context Protocol)

> **"Human-readable code is noise. Machine-to-Machine communication is the Signal."**

## 🚀 The Story: Vibe Coding Revolution
This project was designed and built by a **Non-Developer** in just **4 weeks** using what we call **"Vibe Coding"**—a pure, intent-driven collaboration with AI (Claude/Antigravity). 

While traditional developers focus on how *humans* read code, the architect of this system realized that the future of software belongs to **Autonomous AI Agents**. By stripping away human-centric noise and compressing logic into the **Ω-Spec (Omega Specification)**, this MCP server scales AI intelligence beyond current context limits.

## 🛰️ What is this?
**ANTIGRAVITY Ω-PROTO** is a high-performance **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that optimizes how AI models process and transfer code. It enables:

1.  **Anchor Flow Refactoring**: Automatic hierarchical deduplication. It finds logic overlaps and extracts them into machine-efficient "Anchors".
2.  **Omega Spec Compression**: Replaces verbose programming keywords with single-token symbolic links (e.g., `async` → `Ωj`, `await` → `Ωk`).
3.  **Machine-First Blueprinting**: Prepends a symbolic 'Logic Map' to codes, allowing AI models to understand complex systems in milliseconds without reading every line.
4.  **Zero-Noise Mode**: Automatically strips all human-readable comments and formatting to maximize token efficiency during AI-to-AI transfer.

## 📊 Scalability Benchmarks
The efficiency of **ANTIGRAVITY Ω-PROTO** scales with the complexity and volume of the source code. Unlike standard minifiers, it thrives on the logical redundancy found in large-scale projects.

| Source Type | Original Lines | Compression Efficiency | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Human (Expert) | ~200 lines | **1.9%** | Baseline |
| AI-Generated | ~170 lines | **7.6%** | Optimized |
| AI-Generated | **~6,800 lines** | **22.1%** | High Yield |
| Human (Expert) | **~3,600 lines** | **31.9%** | **Maximum Gain** |

> **Insight**: As code volume grows, the likelihood of structural patterns and "logical gravity" increases. ANTIGRAVITY collapses this weight, delivering higher token density where you need it most.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/antigravity-omega-mcp.git
cd antigravity-omega-mcp
npm install
```

### 3. Register in Claude Desktop
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "antigravity-omega": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/antigravity-omega-mcp/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚓️ Behind the Code: The "Vibe" Philosophy
Traditional coding has 'gravity'—the weight of legacy syntax and human readability. **Antigravity** is about escaping that weight. 

- **Architect**: [User's Name Placeholder / The Visionary]
- **Methodology**: Vibe Coding (4-Week Build)
- **Status**: Machine-First Operational 

"If humans can't read it, but the machine executes it perfectly and cheaper—we've won."
